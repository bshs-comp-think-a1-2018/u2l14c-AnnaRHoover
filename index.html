    <!--Paragraph-->
    <h3>Why we need to read</h3> 
    <p>Reading is an essential part of everyday life. More and more we see kids struggling through childhood in school and those same problems carrying well into adulthood. A majority of these struggles are because kids are no longer being taught to read when they should be being taught. Parents are more prone to putting children in front of a television or give them a device instead of a book. Who can blame them most of the time. It is easier, they don't have to be on top of their child, and in the modern day world, technology is the biggest factor to learn how to use. However, this means the child is not learning how to read until they start school. The older a child gets the harder it is for them to learn these basic and essential skills. The quicker they are taught, the easier everyones life is going to be and the better chance our society has.
      <!--Paragraph 2-->
    <h3>Reading in the modern day world</h3>
    <p>Even though most think reading is becoming obsolete, it is becoming more and more essectial that we do it. As people read less and less, everyday tasks are becomin more difficult to people. Most are more invested in their technological devices than they are using their brain. However, you can easily do both. With all of this technology, there are plenty of resources that can and should be utilized to keep people reading. On any apple device they include a bookstore. There are many apps for you to find any kind of book you could ever imagine. Or, there is even ways to connect movies and television shows to books. Everybody knows that a good handful of books have been turned into movies or vice versa. Make it a goal to read the books before you watch the movie and compare the two.  </p>
